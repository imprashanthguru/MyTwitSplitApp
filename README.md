## Summary

This is an Android App that aims to serve as a Tweeter interface?. The app will allow users to input and send messages. 
If a user's input is less than or equal to 50 characters, we post it as it is. If a user's input is greater than 50 characters, we split it into chunks that each is less than or equal to 50 characters and post each chunk as a separate message.
